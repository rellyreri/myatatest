# Clip Tool

The clip tool lets you cut blocks along a cutting plane.

* Start by selecting the blocks you want to cut in Block mode and then switch to using the Clip tool.
* Click on the block you want to cut in two different places to define the line you want to cut along.
    * You can optionally also click to add a third point.  If only two points are placed, the cutting plane will be perpendicular to the face the cutting line lies along.  Otherwise all three placed points will define the cutting plane.
    * Press Backspace to remove the last placed clipping point.
    * Press Enter to commit the cutting operation.
    * Press Escape to cancel clipping.
