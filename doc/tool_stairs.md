# Stairs Tool

The stairs tool lets you quickly draw sets of stairs.

* Click in empty space or on the surface of a block to place one corner of the base of your staircase.
     * Drag the mouse and release the button to define the base of the stairs area
     * Drag the mouse upwards to define the height of the staircase.  Stairs will created to be as close to the top of the dragged volume as possible.
     * Scroll the mouse wheel to change the direction the staircase is pointing.
     * Use Ctrl-Wheel to change the height of each step.  Ctrl-Shift-Wheel will change the depth of each step.
     * To cancel building the block, press the Escape key.  You can also right click with the mouse.
