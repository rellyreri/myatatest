# Vertex Tool

Edit the vertices of the block.

* Select blocks in Block mode that you want to edit the vertices of, and then switch to the Vertex tool.
* Click on a vertex to select it.
    * You can use the modifier keys to affect how the vertex is added to or removed from the selection.
    * Selected vertices will be displayed in orange.  One vertex may be white which means it is the active vertex, which gives it priority by some commands.
* Click and drag on a vertex to move it.  If you drag a selected vertex, all selected vertices are moved.
    * Vertex will be moved in the XZ plane.  Hold Alt to switch to moving along the Y axis.
* Hold Ctrl and click and drag on the mesh to drag out a new vertex.
* Hover the mouse cursor over another block and press Alt-Q to switch to editing the vertices of that block.
