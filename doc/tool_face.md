# Face Tool

Edit the faces of the block.

* Select blocks in Block mode that you want to edit the faces of, and then switch to the Face tool.
* Click on a face to select it.
    * You can use the modifier keys to affect how the face is added to or removed from the selection.
    * Selected faces will be displayed in orange.  One face may be white which means it is the active face, which gives it priority by some commands.
* Click and drag on a face to move it.  If you drag a selected face, all selected faces are moved.
    * Face will be moved in the XZ plane.  Hold Alt to switch to moving along the Y axis.
* Hover the mouse cursor over another block and press Alt-Q to switch to editing the faces of that block.
